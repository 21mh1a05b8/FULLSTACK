// var is globally Scoped,can be updated and redeclared in its scope(most preferable try to avoid it,it should be used in writing code for older browsers) 
//let is block scoped(Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block) it can be updated bu cannot be redeclared
// const block scoped used when the value is to be fixed or its also should not be changed it can be neither updated nor re-declared it must be initialized during declaration unlike let or var
